# Student Management System

## Description

The Student Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the management of student information, academic performance, and class-related activities. Built with a microservices architecture, the system supports three main user roles: Students, Advisors, and Administrators. It provides functionalities such as student profile management, grade tracking, class management, and a discussion forum.

The application is developed using **ReactJS** for the frontend, **Node.js** for the backend, and **MongoDB** as the database, ensuring scalability, modularity, and a seamless user experience.

## Features

### For Students

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB (v4.4 or higher)
- `npm` or `yarn`

### Steps
1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/Student-Management-System.git
    cd Student-Management-System
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    - For the backend:
      ```bash
      cd backend
      npm install
      ```
    - For the frontend:
      ```bash
      cd ../frontend
      npm install
      ```

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following content:
    ```env
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/student-management
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    EMAIL_SERVICE=your_email_service
    EMAIL_USER=your_email
    EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
    ```

4.  **Run MongoDB:**
    Ensure MongoDB is running locally or provide a cloud-based MongoDB URI in your `.env` file.

5.  **Start the Application:**
    - To start the backend server:
      ```bash
      cd backend
      npm start
      ```
    - To start the frontend application:
      ```bash
      cd ../frontend
      npm start
      ```

6.  **Access the Application:**
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser for the frontend. The backend API runs on `http://localhost:5000` by default.
